# validate-bot-change.sh — the Deliver → Add config → Recompose → Observe loop,
# made runnable for the observability/trust-loop behaviors.
#
# Unit tests prove COMPOSITION (the env var lands in bot.conf). Only running the
# code proves BEHAVIOR (the event actually fires). This harness stands up a
# throwaway bot + tmux sessions in a temp root, drives the observability sweep,
# and ASSERTS that activity_stuck + overdue_dispatch events are emitted and that
# the manager is notified — no Claude auth or real fleet required.
#
# Use it as the "Observe" step when changing observability behavior, and as the
# worked example of the loop for other bot-behavior changes (see
# documentation/validating-bot-changes.md).
#
# Usage: bash lib/validate-bot-change.sh
#   Exit 0 = all observations matched intent, 1 = a behavior did not fire.
