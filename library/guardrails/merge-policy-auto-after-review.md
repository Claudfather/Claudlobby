# Auto-merge after peer review

The manager auto-merges PRs when ALL of:

1. **Peer review posted** — a reviewer has posted an `APPROVE` verdict (or `COMMENT` with `**Approve**` verdict line under same-identity fallback).
2. **CI green — the repo's DECLARED required checks, BY NAME, never by count.** Verify that every check **this repo declares as required** appears in the status rollup by name, and that every one is `SUCCESS`.

   **The required set is declared per repo and is deliberately not listed here.** Workflow names are a property of a repository, not of a fleet: one repo's set may be `Lint` / `Test` / `Security Scan` / `Changelog Check` while another's is `api-ci` / `frontend-ci`. A list written into this guardrail would be correct for exactly one repo and silently wrong on every other — hunting for names that do not exist there, and so either blocking every PR on that repo or, worse, being quietly softened by whoever hits it first. **The softening is the real hazard: a guardrail that fires wrongly gets weakened, and the weakening outlives the repo that caused it.**

   **A repo that cannot declare a stable set declares nothing, and that is the design working rather than a gap in it.** Where workflows are path-filtered — say `api-ci` on `api/**` and `frontend-ci` on `frontend/**` — a docs-only PR triggers neither, so no set is always-present and a required context would strand such a PR permanently. Under a hardcoded list that repo is a special case somebody has to remember; under declaration its exclusion falls out of the design: nothing declared, nothing to verify, and the gap is visible instead of forgotten.

   **ABSENCE is the failure mode, so absence is what this rung tests for.** A PR with conflicts has no computable merge commit, so `pull_request`-triggered workflows are **never scheduled** — while GitHub App integrations keep reporting `SUCCESS` against the head SHA. The rollup then reads all-success *with the entire test suite missing*, and a naive green gate passes. Measured on a real conflicting PR: three checks, all passing, `gh pr checks` exit `0`, no tests run.

   A **count** does not survive this. It is a proxy for "the tests ran": it breaks the moment a workflow is added or removed, and it is satisfied by the wrong N.

   **Read the rollup, not `/check-runs` — because the rollup is GUARANTEED complete and `/check-runs` is only INCIDENTALLY complete.** `statusCheckRollup` is the union of the Checks API and the legacy commit-Status API, so by construction it carries every gate whichever surface reports it. `/check-runs` finds all four names today, and keeps working only for as long as nobody ever adds a required gate as a legacy commit status — which a plain Vercel entry on one of these repos already is. Measured on one real commit: 2 check-runs, 1 status, 3 in the rollup. That is evidence a second surface exists and *can* carry a gate; it is not a claim that any of the four hides there today.

   **Incidentally correct is a proxy** — the same distinction as counting versus naming, one layer down. A thing that happens to be right is not a thing that must be right, and only the second belongs in a guardrail. Use `gh pr view <n> --json statusCheckRollup` or `gh pr checks <n>`.

   **Do not rely on branch protection to enforce this for you.** On this estate it mostly does not exist: of five repos surveyed, three have no branch protection at all, one is protected with zero required contexts, and one is on a plan that cannot have required checks. A repo with no protection merges a plain `gh pr merge` with nothing checked server-side, `--admin` or not.

3. **Mergeable reads `MERGEABLE` explicitly** — never "not `CONFLICTING`". GitHub computes this field **lazily**: the first read after a push returns `UNKNOWN`, and only a re-query resolves it. `UNKNOWN` is not `false`, so a not-conflicting test passes on a field that has not been computed yet. Re-query until the value is `MERGEABLE` or `CONFLICTING`, and treat a persistent `UNKNOWN` as not mergeable.

   This rung is deliberately **not** a `mergeStateStatus` test. That field reports `BLOCKED` for the ordinary case of a PR still awaiting its review, so gating on `clean`/`unstable` refuses PRs that are perfectly mergeable.

Merge command: `gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch`

**Not auto-merged:**
- PRs with `Request Changes` verdict — bounce to engineer first.
- PRs with unresolved review threads.
- PRs where CI is failing or pending — **or where a required workflow is missing from the rollup.** "Not failing" is not "passed": an absent workflow cannot fail.
- PRs the manager authored (self-merge requires a second reviewer).

The manager posts "Merging #NN" to Telegram before executing, so the human has visibility.
